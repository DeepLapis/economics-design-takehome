# Economics Design Takehome
This is my takehome attempt at a data analyst interview for Economics Design

The question was to analyze a set of unique address in each file. The subquestions are:

1) Can you identify Human Addresses, CEX, and Venture Capitalist Funds?

2) Explore the network of these addresses

You can see the PDF that I have uploaded and you can take a look at my attempt. It was my first time learning about on-chain data and it was pretty challenging but I learnt a lot in the assignment
